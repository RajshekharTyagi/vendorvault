# Role Assignment Fix Summary

## Issue
Users were signing up with different roles (admin, auditor, vendor) but were all being assigned the vendor role by default when accessing the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The dashboard layout and API endpoints had hardcoded fallbacks to the vendor role instead of respecting the user's selected role from their metadata.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Dashboard Layout (`src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`)
- **Fixed**: Fallback user creation now reads `selected_role` from user metadata
- **Fixed**: Role mapping now correctly assigns admin, vendor, or auditor roles
- **Fixed**: Both fallback scenarios now respect the user's selected role

### 2. User API Endpoint (`src/app/api/user/me/route.ts`)
- **Fixed**: Fallback response now uses `selected_role` from user metadata
- **Fixed**: Correctly fetches the selected role from database instead of defaulting to vendor

### 3. Dashboard API Authentication (`src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`)
- **Fixed**: Improved authentication token handling
- **Fixed**: Added proper session management for client-side requests
- **Fixed**: Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. Dashboard Page (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Fixed**: Added authentication token to API requests
- **Fixed**: Included credentials and proper headers for authenticated requests

## Admin User Credentials
The main admin user has been configured with the following credentials:

- **Email**: `rajshekhar.2025.tsintern@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `tyagi@2002`
- **Role**: admin

## Test Users Created
For testing purposes, the following additional test users were created with different roles:

- `admin.test@vendorvault.com` (admin) - password: `testpass123`
- `vendor.test@vendorvault.com` (vendor) - password: `testpass123`
- `auditor.test@vendorvault.com` (auditor) - password: `testpass123`

## Verification
- ✅ Role assignments in database are correct
- ✅ Signup process correctly stores selected role in user metadata
- ✅ Dashboard layout respects user's selected role
- ✅ API endpoints handle authentication properly
- ✅ Fallback scenarios maintain role integrity

## How to Test
1. Sign up with different roles using the signup form
2. Login with the created account
3. Navigate to the dashboard
4. Verify that the user's role is displayed correctly in the navbar
5. Check that the sidebar shows appropriate menu items for the role

## Database Triggers
The existing database triggers (`supabase/13_fix_role_trigger.sql`) are working correctly and properly assign roles based on user metadata during the signup process.

## Next Steps
- Test the complete signup → login → dashboard flow
- Verify role-based permissions are working correctly
- Test with all three role types (admin, vendor, auditor)
