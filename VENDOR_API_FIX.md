# Vendor API Authentication Fix

## Issue
Getting 401 HTTP error when trying to add vendors through the vendors page.

## Root Cause
The vendors API endpoint had authentication issues similar to the dashboard API, and the frontend wasn't handling session errors properly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Vendors API Endpoint (`src/app/api/vendors/route.ts`)
- **Fixed**: Removed problematic cookies handling that was causing errors
- **Fixed**: Simplified authentication to use Authorization header only
- **Fixed**: Added proper error handling for token validation
- **Fixed**: Both GET and POST endpoints now handle authentication consistently

### 2. Vendors Page (`src/app/(dashboard)/vendors/page.tsx`)
- **Fixed**: Added better session validation before making API calls
- **Fixed**: Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Fixed**: Added proper 401 error detection and messaging
- **Fixed**: Improved both fetchVendors and handleAddVendor functions

## API Testing Results
✅ **Vendors API is working correctly** when tested with proper authentication:
- GET /api/vendors: Returns 200 with vendors list
- POST /api/vendors: Returns 200 and creates vendor successfully

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still getting 401 errors, try these steps:

### 1. Check Your Login Session
- Make sure you're logged in with valid credentials
- Try logging out and logging back in
- Check browser console for any session errors

### 2. Clear Browser Data
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try using incognito/private browsing mode
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

### 3. Verify Admin Credentials
Use these credentials to log in:
- **Email**: `rajshekhar.2025.tsintern@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `tyagi@2002`

### 4. Check Network Tab
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- Try adding a vendor
- Check if the Authorization header is being sent with the request
- Look for any CORS or network errors

## Expected Behavior
After logging in successfully:
1. Navigate to the Vendors page
2. Click "Add Vendor" button
3. Fill out the vendor form
4. Submit the form
5. Vendor should be created and appear in the list

## Error Messages
The system now provides better error messages:
- "Authentication failed. Please log in again." - for session issues
- "No active session. Please log in again." - for missing sessions
- Specific HTTP error codes for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Log in with the admin credentials
2. Try adding a vendor
3. If issues persist, check the browser console for detailed error messages
4. The API endpoints are confirmed working, so any remaining issues are likely session-related
