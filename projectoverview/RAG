🧠 What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) =
👉 Retrieval (find the most relevant information) +
👉 Generation (use AI to generate a natural-language answer).

It means:

“Don’t just ask the LLM (AI) — first fetch the right facts from your documents, then have the AI explain them.”

So instead of your app’s AI guessing or hallucinating, it uses your own vendor documents, policies, and compliance data as a factual foundation.

🏗️ How RAG Works in VendorVault

Here’s the full lifecycle of RAG inside your project:

🩵 1️⃣ Document Upload (Source Creation)

The vendor uploads documents — e.g., ISO certificate.pdf, CompliancePolicy.docx, Insurance.pdf, etc.

You store them in Supabase Storage and record metadata in your documents table.

Example entry:

{
  "vendor_id": 23,
  "name": "ISO-9001.pdf",
  "file_url": "supabase://storage/vendorvault/ISO-9001.pdf",
  "status": "uploaded"
}

🧩 2️⃣ Text Extraction

You then extract text from these files using:

PDF.js → for digital PDFs

Tesseract.js → for scanned images/OCR

docx-parser or pdf-lib for text parsing

The extracted text is cleaned, chunked, and stored temporarily.

Example chunk:

"Clause 5.1: The vendor shall maintain a quality management system consistent with ISO 9001:2015 standards."

🧮 3️⃣ Embedding Creation (Vectorization)

Each text chunk is converted into a numerical vector (array of floating-point numbers) using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small or OpenRouter equivalent).

You then store these embeddings in Supabase pgvector, along with metadata like document name and vendor ID.

Example (simplified):

id	vendor_id	text_chunk	embedding_vector
1	23	"Clause 5.1..."	[0.024, -0.045, ...]

This enables semantic search — not keyword search, but meaning-based search.

🔍 4️⃣ Retrieval

When a user (admin or auditor) asks a question, e.g.:

“Does Vendor A have ISO certification coverage?”

You embed the question → find top 3–5 semantically similar chunks in Supabase pgvector using cosine similarity.
This step retrieves only relevant document sections.

💬 5️⃣ Augmented Generation

You send both:

The user’s question

The retrieved document context

to the OpenRouter LLM API (Gemini, Mistral, or GPT model).

The prompt might look like this:

System: You are a compliance assistant for VendorVault. 
User question: "Does Vendor A have ISO certification coverage?"

Context:
1. "Clause 5.1: Vendor A has ISO 9001:2015 certification valid till Dec 2025."
2. "Clause 7.3: Annual renewal required for certification."

Answer clearly and reference document sources.


The AI then generates a factual, citation-backed answer:

✅ “Yes, Vendor A holds ISO 9001:2015 certification valid through December 2025.
Refer to Clause 5.1 in ISO-9001.pdf for details.”

📚 6️⃣ Store AI Responses (Knowledge Memory)

You can store the question, answer, and references in your qa_threads table for:

Audit history

🧠 Use Cases of RAG in VendorVault
Use Case	Example Question	Outcome
Policy Q&A	“What are Vendor X’s cybersecurity requirements?”	Fetches policy doc + AI summarizes clause.
Compliance Verification	“Has Vendor Y uploaded proof of insurance?”	Retrieves checklist + insurance doc + confirms.
Audit Readiness	“Which certifications are expiring soon?”	AI cross-checks renewal table + documents.
Gap Analysis	“What’s missing in Vendor Z’s compliance?”	AI compares checklist vs uploaded docs.
Summarization	“Summarize Vendor A’s risk level.”	AI analyzes documents + risk tags.
🧩 Database Tables for RAG
Table	Purpose
documents	Stores original file metadata
ai_embeddings	Stores text chunks + vector embeddings
qa_threads	Stores AI Q&A history
ai_context_cache	(Optional) Cached retrievals for performance
🧠 RAG API Example (Next.js + Supabase + OpenRouter)
// /app/api/ai/query/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { embedText, queryLLM } from "@/lib/ai";

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { vendorId, question } = await req.json();

  // 1️⃣ Embed the question
  const qEmbedding = await embedText(question);

  // 2️⃣ Retrieve relevant docs
  const { data } = await supabase.rpc("match_documents", {
    query_embedding: qEmbedding,
    match_count: 5,
    vendor_id: vendorId,
  });

  const context = data.map((d: any) => d.text_chunk).join("\n");

  // 3️⃣ Generate AI answer
  const answer = await queryLLM(question, context);

  // 4️⃣ Return
  return NextResponse.json({ answer });
}

💎 Benefits of RAG in VendorVault

🧾 In Simple Words

RAG turns your VendorVault from a normal dashboard into a smart compliance assistant.
It helps you understand the documents — not just store them.
Admins can ask:

“Is Vendor X compliant with ISO 27001?”
…and get a clear, trustworthy answer backed by real documents.
